rust-libpoly
============

The Rust bindings for the libPOLY computer music library

libPOLY isnâ€™t packaged with these bindings. You can grab it from https://github.com/traviswhitaker/libPOLY
It is expected that libpoly.so will be available somewhere in your library search path.
Both libPOLY and these bindings are under active development so expect things to change.
